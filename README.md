## 🌟 The Vision Behind Mendeleev
The universe is built from 118 fundamental blocks. Traditional periodic tables are flat, static, and often boring. **Mendeleev** was born to change that. We've combined **Science**, **Art**, and **Code** to create a living, breathing periodic table that feels more like a control center for a spaceship than a textbook page.

This project isn't just a list of elements; it's a high-performance educational engine designed to spark curiosity.

## 🎨 Visual Journey & Interface

### 🌌 1. The Galactic Core (Main Interface)
Our main dashboard utilizes a deep-space aesthetic. With a **Starfield Animation** background and **Glassmorphic** element cells, the interface provides a premium feel. 

- **Interactive Hover:** Each element reacts to your touch, revealing immediate data.
- **Smart Filtering:** Elements are categorized by vibrant gradients that represent their chemical groups.

</p>

### 🔬 2. The Micro-Universe (Atomic Modeling)
We don't just tell you how many electrons an element has; **we show them in motion.** 
Using custom-built logic, our platform generates a **Real-Time Bohr Model**.
- **Dynamic Physics:** Electron rotation speeds are optimized for visual clarity.
- **Shell Accuracy:** Every shell (K, L, M, N...) is drawn according to real quantum physics data.

</p>

### 📱 3. Chemistry in Your Pocket (Mobile Precision)
Fitting a massive grid into a smartphone screen is a feat of engineering. Our mobile version features a **Liquid-Responsive Grid**. No data is lost, no text is too small—just pure, portable science.
