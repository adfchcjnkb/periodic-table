## 💎 The Vision
**Mendeleev** is not just a periodic table; it is a digital sanctuary for chemistry enthusiasts. Designed with the precision of a laboratory and the beauty of a modern art gallery, this platform brings the building blocks of life to your screen with **Glassmorphism design** and **liquid-smooth animations**.

---

## 🚀 Development Spotlight & Roadmap

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### 🛠️ Backend Construction (Underway)
> We are currently building a powerful backend architecture. Soon, Mendeleev will transition from a static tool to a social educational platform featuring user accounts, cloud-saved "Favorite Elements," and a global research database.

> [!TIP]
> ### 🌍 Breaking Language Barriers (Bilingual Update)
> Currently, the platform fully supports **Persian (RTL)**. We are actively working on a **Complete Bilingual Overhaul**. In the coming updates, a global toggle will allow users to switch instantly between English and Persian, making this science available to everyone on Earth.

## 🎬 Visual Tour

### 🔭 1. The Interactive Dashboard
Experience a futuristic UI where every element is an entry point to deep scientific knowledge. The main interface features a responsive star-field background and cells that react to your presence.
- **UI Interaction:** The element cells feature **hover-scaling** and **neon glow** effects.
- **Glassmorphism:** A modern frosted-glass effect that keeps the UI clean and premium.

</p>

### ⚛️ 2. Live Atomic Bohr Models
Witness the atom in motion. When you select an element, the platform calculates and draws its Bohr model in real-time using CSS and JS.
- **Dynamic Physics:** Electrons orbit their nucleus at smooth intervals.
- **Visual Accuracy:** Every shell is distinct, showing the electron configuration (K, L, M, N...) accurately.
